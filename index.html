						DO NOT use a 1x1 semi transparent PNG. Size the PNG up to 10x10, 100x100, etc. Whatever makes sense on your page. (I used a 200x200 PNG and it was only 0.25 kb, so there's no real concern over file size here.) 
						After visiting this post, I created my web page with 3, 1x1 PNGs with varying transparency.
						Dreamweaver CS5 was tanking. I was having flash backs to DOS!!! Apparently any time I tried to scroll, insert text, basically do anything, DW was trying to reload the semi transparent areas 1x1 pixel at a time ... YIKES!

						Adobe tech support didn't even know what the problem was, but told me to rebuild the file (it worked on their systems, incidentally). It was only when I loaded the first transparent PNG into the css file that the doc dove deep again.
						Then I found a post on another help site about PNGs crashing Dreamweaver. Size your PNG up; there's no downside to doing so.
